# GraphQL Federation


GraphQL Federation es una extensión del lenguaje de programación GraphQL query que permite construir y manejar una GraphQL API unificando multiples servicios GraphQL. 


is an extension of the GraphQL query language and server implementation that allows you to build and manage a unified GraphQL API from multiple individual GraphQL services. It's designed to address the challenges of scaling and organizing GraphQL APIs in a microservices architecture.

In a typical microservices architecture, each service might have its own GraphQL API, which can become challenging to manage as the number of services grows. GraphQL Federation provides a solution to this problem by allowing you to compose a single, unified GraphQL API that can query and fetch data from multiple underlying services.

Key concepts and components of GraphQL Federation include:

1. **Entities:** Entities are objects that exist across multiple services. Each entity has a unique identifier that's used to associate data across services.

2. **Services:** Services are individual GraphQL APIs that provide data for specific parts of your application. Each service can define its own types, queries, and mutations.

3. **Gateway:** The gateway is a layer that sits in front of the individual services and routes incoming GraphQL queries to the appropriate service. It also performs composition, merging results from multiple services into a single response.

4. **Type Extensions:** Services can extend types defined in other services. For example, one service might define a "User" type, and another service can extend that type to add additional fields.

5. **Federation Directives:** GraphQL Federation introduces special directives like `@key` and `@extends` that allow you to specify how types are related and how they can be extended by other services.

The benefits of GraphQL Federation include:

- **Scalability:** You can independently develop and deploy services that match the boundaries of your microservices architecture.

- **Efficiency:** Clients can request only the data they need, and the gateway can optimize and parallelize requests to the underlying services.

- **Organization:** Federation encourages clear ownership and separation of concerns for different parts of your application.

GraphQL Federation is often used in conjunction with tools like Apollo Federation or Apollo Gateway to simplify the implementation of the gateway and management of federated services. It's a powerful approach for building flexible and scalable GraphQL APIs in complex, distributed systems.



Federating GraphQL is a popular approach for companies with large, distributed architectures where scalability and flexibility are paramount. For example, Adobe uses GraphQL federation across 40 API endpoints to improve their team’s agility and velocity; meanwhile Netflix developed a federated GraphQL platform to quickly and reliably scale their API for their studio ecosystem.
